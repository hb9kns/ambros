# AMBROS

*A*utomatic *M*orse code *BRO*adcasting *S*ystem

Is Morse-Code on the way to die? It migh be, if not used anymore...
To increase the amount of Morse code transmissions available to
listeners, broadcast stations are needed that process interesting
texts and transmit them for human ears: Morse-Code Broadcasting!

In the end, AMBROS shall be a completely automatic and autonomous
system, collecting textual data from different sources (online or
offline), filtering them according to predefined rules, assembling
the resulting texts into a contiuous transmission schedule, and
broadcasting them via an attached transmitter system.

On the hardware side, a low-cost computer and a suitable transmitter
are needed. Depending on the chosen transmitter type, software
drivers may be needed.
